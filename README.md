# E-Accounting

This project is an e-accounting project. It was developed using .NET 8 for the backend and Angular 17 for the frontend. By leveraging SignalR and charts, sales and outputs are displayed on the homepage in real time and sorted chronologically. JWT Authentication is implemented for token validation, along with role-based management via cookies. Docker was used for email sending and account creation processes. The system supports working with different companies using different databases, and direct database addition and update functionalities have been integrated into the frontend. MS SQL Server was used as the database with the Code First approach. To make the project compatible with real-life scenarios, fake data was generated using the Bogus library, and a fake data generation service was added to the frontend. For fast data retrieval and to prevent time loss, a memory cache service was used, and pagination was implemented for data listing. The infrastructure for a Redis cache service has also been set up for future use. My goal in this project was to develop a user-friendly e-accounting web application with the required features using modern technologies, and I have successfully achieved that goal.
